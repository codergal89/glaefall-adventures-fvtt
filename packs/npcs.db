She is in her early thirties and took over the inn from her parents when they moved to Stillwharf. Most of her time is spent cooking all sorts of hearty meals and baking bread that alledgely is to die for. When she is not preparing food for her guests, she enjoys chatting and gossipping with her patrons. Shes is known for playing a mean hand of Three Dragon Ante, so much so that people who don't know her might suspect her of cheating.</p>\n<p>She usually wears simple clothes, namely a slightly off-white and puffy blouse. Over her blouse, she usually wears one of her cotton wests. Her legs are covered by a matching skirt that almost reaches to the ground. From underneath her skirt, simple dark grey cloth boots with thick leather soles peak out. Due to sanitary reasons, she wears her burdundyu hair made up into a simple bun when she is at work in the inn. During her off-time however, she enjoys to wear her hair open, reaching a couple of inches below her shoulders.</p>\n<p>On the tenth day of the week she can often be found taking a walk in the forest, picking mushrooms or pillow moss. She also likes to visit the Merfolk near Glimmercove to trade news and gossip in exchange for their delicious Merfoam Bubbles. From time to time however, one would be able to meet her at the hidden hut of Conny, the \"Hemlock Witch\", assuming one knows how to find it. Bridget is convinced that not a single Brooktonian knows about her and Conny, but then she also believes her super-secret Foamcake recipe is actually a secret.</p>\n<p>With only little time to pursue activities outside the inn, Bridget has dabbled in learning basic spells to help around around the house and amuse the guests. For the longest time she tried to convince Leofric to teach her how to apply her magic more effectively, but he insisted that \"Magic is best learned on your own, Bridgi!\" Since the new laws have gone into effect however, she was too worried about getting caught without a license too continue practicing.</p>\n<h1>Interest and Forces</h1>\n<p>What the townsfolk love most about Bridget is her loving and welcoming nature. It is because of these qualities or hers, that despite being located outside of town, the Brookton Inn is very much an integral social component of every Brooktonian's life.</p>\n<h2>Interests</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get to know interesting people from all around the world.</li>\n<li>Provide a safe evironment for everyone</li>\n<li>Qualify for a Magic License</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Forces</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to spend more time with Conny - <strong>BUT</strong> - I need to keep the inn open.</li>\n<li>I want to get a formal training in magic - <strong>BUT</strong> - I cannot afford the cost.</li>\n<li>I want for Conny and Zingora to be a family again - <strong>BUT</strong> - The rift between them has grown over many decades.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic good","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"human","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":1,"spellLevel":1,"xp":{"value":10},"source":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":null},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":null},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":null},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":null},"languages":{"value":["common","dwarvish","halfling"],"custom":null}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex"},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str"},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha"},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int"},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis"},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha"},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"},"nat":{"value":1,"ability":"int"},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha"},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha"},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex"},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex"},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Bridget Reede","img":"icons/environment/people/commoner.webp","displayName":20,"actorLink":true,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"lightColor":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"Lap47MXiWj51gorV","name":"Druidcraft","type":"spell","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/vines-jade-1.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Whispering to the spirits of Nature, you create one of the following Effects within range:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours.
